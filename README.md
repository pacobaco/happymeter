# Sentiment Analysis and Ranking Tool using NLTK

## Overview
This project implements a sentiment analysis and ranking tool using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) in Python. The tool analyzes a corpus of textual data and ranks documents based on their sentiment scores. It aims to provide insights into the overall sentiment expressed in a collection of documents, making it valuable for tasks such as content analysis, opinion mining, and sentiment tracking.

## Features
1. **Sentiment Analysis:** Utilizes NLTK's `SentimentIntensityAnalyzer` to compute sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral, compound) for each document in the corpus.
   
2. **Keyword Search:** Enables searching through the document corpus based on user-defined keywords.
   
3. **Ranking by Sentiment:** Ranks search results based on their sentiment scores, facilitating easy identification of documents with high positive or negative sentiment.

4. **Export to CSV:** Allows exporting of ranked results, including sentiment scores, to a CSV file for further analysis or reporting.

## Usage
### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NLTK library (`nltk`)

### Installation
1. Install NLTK:
   ```bash
   pip install nltk
   ```

2. Download NLTK resources (if not already downloaded):
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('vader_lexicon')
   ```

### Example Usage
```python
# Import necessary modules
from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
import csv

# Initialize sentiment analyzer
sid = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()

# Sample corpus (replace with your actual corpus loading functionality)
corpus = [
    {"id": 1, "content": "Doc is the leader of the seven dwarfs and is often portrayed as wise and knowledgeable."},
    {"id": 2, "content": "Grumpy is easily annoyed and is often pessimistic. Despite his gruff exterior, he cares deeply for his fellow dwarfs."},
    # Add more documents as needed
]

# Function to search corpus by keyword
def search_corpus_by_keyword(keyword, corpus):
    results = [doc for doc in corpus if keyword.lower() in doc['content'].lower()]
    return results

# Function to analyze sentiment of content
def analyze_sentiment(content):
    return sid.polarity_scores(content)["compound"]

# Function to rank results by sentiment score
def rank_results_by_sentiment(results):
    for result in results:
        result['sentiment_score'] = analyze_sentiment(result['content'])
    ranked_results = sorted(results, key=lambda x: x['sentiment_score'], reverse=True)
    return ranked_results

# Function to export ranked results to CSV
def export_to_csv(ranked_results, filename='ranked_results.csv'):
    keys = ranked_results[0].keys()
    with open(filename, 'w', newline='') as output_file:
        dict_writer = csv.DictWriter(output_file, fieldnames=keys)
        dict_writer.writeheader()
        dict_writer.writerows(ranked_results)

# Example usage
keyword = "friend"
search_results = search_corpus_by_keyword(keyword, corpus)
ranked_results = rank_results_by_sentiment(search_results)

# Print ranked search results by sentiment
print("Ranked Search Results by Sentiment:")
for i, result in enumerate(ranked_results, start=1):
    print(f"{i}. {result['content']} - Sentiment Score: {result['sentiment_score']}")

# Export ranked results to CSV
export_to_csv(ranked_results)
```

## Conclusion
This tool provides a straightforward approach to analyze and rank sentiment in textual data using NLTK's sentiment analysis capabilities. It aims to assist users in extracting meaningful insights from text collections, making it suitable for various applications in content analysis and sentiment tracking.
